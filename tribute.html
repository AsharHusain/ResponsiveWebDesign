            <h2>About Dr. Norman Borlaug</h2>
            <p>Dr. Norman Borlaug (1914â€“2009) was an American agronomist and humanitarian who is often called the "father of the Green Revolution." His development of high-yield, disease-resistant wheat varieties helped avert famine and significantly increased food production in countries like Mexico, India, and Pakistan during the mid-20th century.</p>
            <p>Borlaug's work saved an estimated one billion people from starvation, earning him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the Congressional Gold Medal. His legacy continues to influence global agriculture and food security efforts.</p>
